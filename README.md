# 🐍 Python Practice – From Basics to OOP

Welcome to my Python programming practice repository!  
This repo contains hands-on code examples and exercises I’ve worked through as part of my journey to strengthen my **Python foundations**, with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### ✅ Basics
- Print statements, variables, data types
- Input/output
- Conditional logic (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- `range()`, pattern printing, number logic

### ✅ Collections
- Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, methods
- Tuples and immutability
- Sets and operations
- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries

### ✅ Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Arguments and return values
- Recursive functions (factorial, Fibonacci, reverse string)

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- `class` and `object`
- `__init__()` constructor
- Class attributes vs instance attributes
- Instance methods and class-level tracking
- `@staticmethod` usage
- Encapsulation with `__private` variables + getter/setter
- Abstraction using `abc` module
- Inheritance and method overriding
